              "\"\\n\\nOne of Ruskin Bond's most popular works is his short story, The Night Train at Deoli. Set in the beautiful hills of Mussoorie, the story follows a young boy named Raju, who is travelling alone by train to stay with his uncle. As the train makes its way through the night, Raju meets a variety of characters including a mysterious old man who tells him stories of the ghostly sights that can be seen along the railway line at night. Along his journey, Raju discovers the beauty of the night-time landscape and the power of friendship. This story is a part of Ruskin Bond's anthology, Immortal Stories, which has been compiled by Bond himself. In this anthology, Bond has brought together a variety of themes and writing styles, from adventure and mystery, to humour and pathos, as well as the joy of life and the pain of death. This collection of classic stories, which includes The Night Train at Deoli, was compiled by Bond with the intention of providing Indian children with exposure to classic literature. On February 18, 1993, the Sahitya Akademi of India presented Ruskin Bond the award for the most outstanding Indian writer in English, in part for this story.\""
